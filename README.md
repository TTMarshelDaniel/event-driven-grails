# Event Driven Grails Microservice
This example is an addition to my event-driven-spring-boot project on GitHub (https://github.com/mploed/event-driven-spring-boot)
The project is based on Grails and leverages the Grails 3 Event System for processing internal events as well as RabbitMQ as a message broker.

## Getting it up and running
You need to have the event-driven-spring-boot project up and running and should stop the **scoring** microservice in order 
to start this Grails application with _grails run-app_

## Background
This example originated from my talk at Gr8Conf 2017 in Copenhagen

## NOTE: 
This may be outdated with newer version of Grails
